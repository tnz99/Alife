The Paper Boat

On a quiet morning by the river, a little girl named Maya folded a scrap of paper into a boat. She whispered a wish into its creases and set it afloat.

The boat bobbed gently, carrying her secret down the shimmering water. A curious bird flew low, as if trying to hear the whisper too.

Weeks later, Maya returned to the riverbank and found a tiny bottle caught in the reeds. Inside was a note, written in neat handwriting:

"I found your wish. Itâ€™s beautiful. Keep believing."

She smiled, holding the bottle to her heart, certain that somewhere, someone was wishing for her too.
