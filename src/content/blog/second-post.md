When shadows press and doubts take hold,

And dreams feel small, not bright or bold,

Remember—stars are born in night,

They find their way, they make their light.

Your path may twist, the climb seem steep,

But treasures wait for those who leap.

The winds may howl, the storms may roar,

Yet every wave will reach the shore.

So lift your gaze, breathe deep, stand tall,

The world makes room for those who call.

For every step, though slow, you take,

Is proof that mountains, too, can shake.

One spark can start a warming flame,

And yours will set the skies aflame.

Keep moving forward—through, not round—

Your brightest self is waiting to be found.
