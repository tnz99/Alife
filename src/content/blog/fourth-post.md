[{"insert":"---\ntitle: 'Fourth post'\ndescription: 'The Story of the Buddha and the Mustard Seed'\npubDate: 'August 14 2025'\nheroImage: '../../assets/buddha.jpg'\n---\n\nOne day, a woman named Kisa Gotami came to the Buddha, carrying her only child in her arms. The child had died, but she could not accept it. With tears streaming down her face, she begged the Buddha:\n\n\"Please, master, give me medicine to bring my son back to life.\"\n\nThe Buddha looked at her with compassion and said,\n\"There is a way, but first, bring me a handful of mustard seeds from a family that has never known death.\"\n\nHope sparked in her heart. She went from house to house, asking:\n\"Please, can you give me mustard seeds? But only if no one in your family has died.\"\n\nAt each door, people offered mustard seeds, but every family told a similar story—someone they loved had passed away.\n\nBy the end of the day, she had no seeds, but she had gained something far greater: understanding. She returned to the Buddha and said,\n\"Now I see—death comes to every home. My grief is not mine alone.\"\n\nThe Buddha gently replied,\n\"All things are impermanent. Understanding this truth frees the heart from suffering.\"\n\nKisa Gotami laid her child to rest, and from that day on, she followed the Buddha’s teachings, finding peace within herself.\n\nMoral of the story:\nSuffering is a part of life, but wisdom comes when we accept impermanence. In letting go, we find freedom.\n"}]
